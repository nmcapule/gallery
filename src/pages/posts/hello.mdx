### Do you know what is happening?

This is my first post to this site! but is it?

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    shikiConfig: {
      // Choose from Shiki's built-in themes (or add your own)
      // https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/themes.md
      theme: "dracula",
      // Add custom languages
      // Note: Shiki has countless langs built-in, including .astro!
      // https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md
      langs: [],
      // Enable word wrap to prevent horizontal scrolling
      wrap: true,
    },
  },
});
```

```js
I couldn't wait for you to come and clear the cupboard
But now you're gone and leaving nothing but a sign
Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines
Because I miss you all the time

So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
And let yourself go
Is that a compromise?

So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope it all works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know, ahh

And I'm awar–µ that you were lying in the gutter
'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide
So when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies
And why do I still wanna call you (call you, call you, call you)

So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
A handshake with you, what's your point of view?
I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go
'Cause I really wanna stay at your house
And I hope it all works out
But you know how much you broke me apart
I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you
I don't wanna know

Ohh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I'm no one

So, get away
Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know
And let yourself go
You know you didn't lose your self-control
Let's start at the rainbow
Turn away
Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go
And let yourself go
Is that a compromise?

So what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?
There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?
